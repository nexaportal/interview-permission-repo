## Introduction

This project is a Django-based web application that provides APIs for content management with fine-grained permission controls. It leverages Django REST Framework for API development and uses token-based authentication for securing endpoints. The application features a custom permission system that allows for role-based access control with additional constraints based on content language.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Assign roles to users with specific permissions.
- **Language-Specific Permissions**: Control access to content based on language.
- **Token Authentication**: Secure APIs using DRF's token authentication.
- **Swagger Integration**: Interactive API documentation available at `/swagger/`.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Robust test suite covering various permission scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- Virtualenv (recommended)

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bahaminabbasi/interview-permission-repo.git
cd yourproject
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
```sh
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On Unix or MacOS:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure that the `requirements.txt` file exists in the root directory and includes all necessary packages.

## Running Migrations

Before running the project, apply the database migrations to set up the necessary tables:
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```
This will create the database schema based on your Django models.

## Running the Project

Start the Django development server using:
```sh
    python manage.py runserver
```
The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/` by default.

## Swagger Documentation

API documentation is available via Swagger UI. You can access it at:

    http://localhost:8000/swagger/

Replace `localhost:8000` with the appropriate host and port if different.

## Authentication

This project uses Django REST Framework's token-based authentication. To access secured endpoints, you need to include a valid authentication token in your requests.

### Obtaining a Token

To obtain an authentication token, you typically need to send a POST request to the login endpoint with your username and password. For example:

    POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/auth/login/
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "username": "yourusername",
      "password": "yourpassword"
    }

The response will include a token:

    {
      "token": "yourauthtoken"
    }

### Using the Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

    Authorization: Token yourauthtoken

## Permission Per Language System

The application features a custom permission system that controls user access based on roles and the language of content. Permissions are defined per language, and users can have different permissions for different languages.

### Models Overview

- **User**: Extends Django's `AbstractUser`, includes a `mobile` field and a ManyToMany relationship with `RolePerm`.
- **Role**: Represents a user role (e.g., Editor, Viewer).
- **Perm**: Defines a permission, including the action (e.g., create, update) and the language it applies to.
- **RolePerm**: Associates a `Role` with a `Perm`.
- **PostItem**: Represents content items with a language and author.

### Permission Checks

Permissions are enforced using custom permission classes and helper functions. Key components include:

- **HasRolePermission**: A custom DRF permission class that checks if a user has the required role-based permission for an action and language.
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `check_user_is_owner(user, obj)`: Checks if the user is the author of the object.
  - `check_user_permission_for_object(user, obj, mapped_action, action)`: Checks if the user has permission to perform an action on an object, considering ownership and language.

### Permission Flow

1. **User Authentication**: The user authenticates and provides a token with each request.
2. **Permission Assignment**: Users are assigned roles, and roles are associated with permissions for specific actions and languages.
3. **Request Handling**:
   - For list actions, the queryset is filtered based on the user's permissions for different languages.
   - For object-level actions (retrieve, update, delete), permissions are checked using the helper functions, considering both the action and the language of the content.
4. **Ownership Verification**: For actions that modify content (update, delete), the user must be the owner (author) of the content.

### Example Usage

- A user with the `Editor` role can have `update` permissions for English content but not for French content.
- The permission system ensures that users can only perform actions they are explicitly permitted to, and only on content in languages they have permissions for.

### Field-Level Permissions

The application includes a custom serializer base class, `FieldPermissionSerializer`, which enforces field-level permissions for both read and write operations. By inheriting from this class, other serializers can apply field-level access control based on user permissions.

#### Usage
Just inherit `FieldPermissionSerializer` on your model serializers:
```python
class PostItemSerializer(FieldPermissionSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = PostItem
        fields = '__all__'
```

### Overview

The `FieldPermissionSerializer` overrides the default serialization and validation methods to check user permissions for each field during serialization (read) and deserialization (write).

### Key Features

- **Field-Level Read Permissions**: Controls which fields are included in the serialized output based on the user's permissions.
- **Field-Level Write Permissions**: Validates that the user has permission to modify specific fields during create or update operations.
- **Dynamic Permission Checks**: Utilizes the user's role-based permissions to determine access at runtime.

### Implementation

Here's the implementation of the `FieldPermissionSerializer`:

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the permission system works as expected.

### Running Tests

Execute the tests using:
```sh
pytest
```
or
```sh
python -m pytest
```
### Test Coverage

The tests cover various scenarios, including:

- **Ownership Tests**: Confirm that users can only modify content they own.
- **Permission Assignment Tests**: Verify that users gain or lose access appropriately when permissions are assigned or removed.
- **Content Modification Tests**: Ensure that changes to content attributes (e.g., language) affect permissions as expected.
- **Dynamic Permission Changes**: Test the system's behavior when permissions or roles are modified during runtime.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios like deleting permissions, roles, or related objects to ensure the system remains stable.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a robust permission system that integrates role-based access control with language-specific permissions. By following the setup instructions and understanding the permission flow, you can effectively utilize and extend the system for your application's needs.
